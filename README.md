Applied Natural Language Processing in Engineering (NU)

## Project Overview

This project aims to guide students through the complete lifecycle of an NLP project. NLP projects typically revolve around enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in ways that are meaningful and useful for the purposes of automating language-related tasks, enhancing communication, analyzing language for insights, facilitating accessibility, supporting knowledge retrieval and management, advancing AI understanding of human language or solving industry-specific problems. 

For this course projects, teams of up to three students will submit a detailed project proposal outlining their goals, problem statement, dataset selection, and expected outcomes. Following proposal approval, teams will develop their chosen NLP models using appropriate frameworks, maintaining a well-documented GitHub repository. The models will be evaluated using relevant performance metrics, with insights and potential improvements discussed. Finally, teams will submit a comprehensive report and a video presentation summarizing their project journey and findings.
